BimConsiderationForum and BCF Server
===============================

BCF Server is a Wordpress plugin to create a 'BCF topic server' from your wordpress installation (including a webservice API).  Ready for BCF 2.0, communicating with BIMserver.org.  
BimConsiderationForum is a html/javascript 'dashboard' that combines BIMserver, BIM Surfer and BCF Server into a single view.  

This product was initiated and financed by:
- ZEEP Architects (www.zeep-architecten.nl)
- Quinta Engineers (www.quintaib.nl)
Implementation was done under the supervision of the Netherlands organisation for applied scientific research TNO (www.tno.nl).

This project uses BIM Surfer (www.bimsurfer.org) and relies on BIMserver (www.bimserver.org) and Wordpress (www.wordpress.org).

Roadmap:
- integrate BCF server and Forum into one Wordpress plugin
- integrate Forum as plugin in bimvie.ws
- implement BCF REST API in server
