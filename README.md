BCF Server and Forum
===============================

BCF Server is a Wordpress plugin to create a 'BCF topic server' from your wordpress installation (including a webservice API).  Ready for BCF 2.0, communicating with BIMserver.org.  
BimConsiderationForum is a html/javascript 'dashboard' that combines BIMserver, BIM Surfer and BCF Server into a single view.
