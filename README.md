BimConsiderationForum and BCF Server
===============================

BCF Server is a Wordpress plugin to create a 'BCF topic server' from your wordpress installation (including a webservice API).  Ready for BCF 2.0, communicating with BIMserver.org.  
BimConsiderationForum is a html/javascript 'dashboard' that combines BIMserver, BIM Surfer and BCF Server into a single view.  

This product was initiated and financed by:
- Netherlands organisation for applied scientific research TNO (www.tno.nl)
- Quinta Engineers (www.quintaib.nl)
Implementation was done under the supervision of the Netherlands organisation for applied scientific research TNO (www.tno.nl).
The idea to exchange status information about IFC objects came from ZEEP Architects (www.zeep-architecten.nl).

This project uses BIM Surfer (www.bimsurfer.org) and relies on BIMserver (www.bimserver.org) and Wordpress (www.wordpress.org).

Roadmap:
- integrate BCF server and Forum into one Wordpress plugin --> Work in progress at this moment
- integrate Forum as plugin in bimvie.ws
- implement Buildingsmart BCF REST API
